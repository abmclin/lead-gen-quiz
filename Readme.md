Description of Lead Generation Quiz's implementation.

The quiz is implemented using surveyjs.io JavaScript library. The quiz pages and questions are all implemented as a JSON object which describe its layout, settings, and options.

When the frontend is loaded by client browser, the quiz is dynamically created by surveyjs based on the information in the JSON config.

Right now I used one of the landing pages examples provided by Francesca as a HTML template to put the quiz in and used default styling out of the box. The quiz's styling can be customized by applying CSS rules to various
classes that are created by surveyjs but surveyjs also provides you with way to insert custom CSS classes into the HTML that's dynamically generated by surveyjs.

I believe it would just be a matter of applying Lindsay's CSS design to the right HTML elements and if necessary add extra CSS and HTML elements to make the styling come out right.
